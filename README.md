This Arduino library allows you to easily generate text and graphics
and send them to a BLE thermal printer. Since there are many different
BLE APIs depending on the board manufacturer, I decided to support the more
popular ones - ESP32 and Arduino Nano BLE 33.

This is still a work in progress, but is mostly feature complete<br>
